    <p style="color: pink;">why should I adopt a cat?</p>
      <p style="color: pink;">Adopting kittens in the United States is a compassionate and responsible choice. Shelters and rescue organizations are often overwhelmed with cats in need of homes, especially during "kitten season." By adopting, you are providing a loving home to a vulnerable animal, helping to reduce overpopulation, and freeing up shelter resources for other animals in need. Additionally, adoption is often more affordable than buying from breeders, and many shelters ensure that kittens are spayed or neutered, vaccinated, and health-checked before going to their new homes. It's a fulfilling way to make a positive difference in both your life and the life of a rescued kitten.</p>
